On November 1, 2006 [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116234941031409783) reported that Nevada Congressman Jim Gibbons was being acccused of receiving bribes in the form of gifts and payments from Warren Trepp, Dennis Montgomery's business partner in [selling phony terrorism-fighting software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmDUaK06gl0) to the Department of Defense.

Montgomery made the allegations in sworn testimony as part of a lawsuit between he and Trepp.

Despite the scandal, Gibbons would become Governor of Nevada. But in May 2007 [NBC reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna18613647) he was under FBI investigation for the alleged bribe from Trepp.

Despite Montgomery working with the FBI, after 18 months they found no evidence of wrongdoing and [the case against Gibbons was dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/us/03nevada.html).

Montgomery had [two of his attorneys withdraw](https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/governor-says-truth-coming-out/) from the case after a compuer expert determined **Montgomery had fabricated at least one of the emails** used as the basis for the case against Gibbons.

Montgomery would also pay a settlement to Trepp for false statements made in public. Per the New York Times:

> The investigation, Mr. Lowell said, might have been slowed by a civil lawsuit between Mr. Montgomery and eTreppid, which was settled last month.
>
> Blxware LLC, the company where Mr. Montgomery now works, said the terms of the settlement were confidential, but the company, based in Bellevue, Wash., disclosed that **the agreement included a payment to Mr. Trepp as “compensation for certain allegations”** made against him in the news media. Blxware was a party in the lawsuit.

Montgomery's own lawyer in the Trepp suit [ended up suing Montgomery himself](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/img-src-http-www-tpmmuckraker-com-images-gibbons1-jpg-vspace-5-hspace-5-align-left-gibbons-accuser-called-pathological-liar) and stated in a filing:

> “Montgomery has told me so many different lies about so many things, it is virtually impossible to determine the ‘true facts,’ let alone what parts of his statements are outright false, partially false, misleading or have grains of truth…”
>
> “He is a perfect example of the principle that if you tell a big enough lie, people will believe you.”

So to recap, Montgomery was found to have:

- Defamed his former partner.
- Made false bribery accusations.
- Fabricated evidence.
- Had two lawyers quit due to fabricated evidence.
- Had another lawyer sue him and call him a habitual liar.

If you're keeping score, that's 5 Ls for Montgomery and zero for everyone else. And every story about Montgomery seems to go the same way. 

Yet he still has considerable influence, somehow.

As a reminder, some 13 years later he would be back in the spotlight as the source behind the scam election fraud propaganda pushed by Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn, Patrick Byrne and many others.
