In May 2007 [NBC reported](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna18613647) that Nevada Governor Jim Gibbons was under FBI investigation for alleged gifts and payments from Warren Trepp, Dennis Montgomery's business partner in [selling phony terrorism-fighting software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmDUaK06gl0) to the Department of Defense.

After 18 months, the FBI found no evidence of wrongdoing and [the case was dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/us/03nevada.html).

### Another L for Montgomery.

The New York Times reports that he also had to pay a settlement to his former business partner for claims against him made in public:

> The investigation, Mr. Lowell said, might have been slowed by a civil lawsuit between Mr. Montgomery and eTreppid, which was settled last month.
>
> Blxware LLC, the company where Mr. Montgomery now works, said the terms of the settlement were confidential, but the company, based in Bellevue, Wash., disclosed that **the agreement included a payment to Mr. Trepp as “compensation for certain allegations”** made against him in the news media. Blxware was a party in the lawsuit.

## ANOTHER L for Montgomery.

Montgomery's lawyer in the copyright lawsuit against Trepp [ended up suing Montgomery himself](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/img-src-http-www-tpmmuckraker-com-images-gibbons1-jpg-vspace-5-hspace-5-align-left-gibbons-accuser-called-pathological-liar) and stated in a filing:

> “Montgomery has told me so many different lies about so many things, it is virtually impossible to determine the ‘true facts,’ let alone what parts of his statements are outright false, partially false, misleading or have grains of truth…”
>
> “He is a perfect example of the principle that if you tell a big enough lie, people will believe you.”



As a reminder, some 13 years later he would be back in the spotlight as the source behind the scam election fraud propaganda pushed by Sidney Powell, Michael Flynn, Patrick Byrne and many others.
