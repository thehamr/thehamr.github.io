In the lead up to the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, a group of alternative news personalities, wealthy businessmen, prominent lawyers, former intelligence officers, and retired military coordinated an operation, in plain sight, to convince the public of election fraud by way of remote hacking of voting machines by foreign interests on behalf of Joe Biden.

The campaign began October 31, when fake news peddler **Mary Fanning** posted an article to her fake news blog The American Report that claimed China, Iran and others planned to use a **supercomputer** called Hammer and Scorecard to remotely compromise U.S. electronic voting machines in order to alter the machine's vote tally to ensure a victory for Democrat nominee Joe Biden.

The disinformation began making the social media rounds, getting a big boost from pillow magnate **Mike Lindell**, who Tweeted a link to Fanning's article to his **413,000+ followers**.

It was also quickly picked up by alternative news, as **Steve Bannon** hosted **Lt. General Tom McInerney** and **Sidney Powell**,  prominent attorney for **General Michael Flynn**, to promote the Hammer and Scorecard disinfo on his WarRoom podcast. 

Two days after the election, when a Biden victory was looking more and more likely, Powell went on Fox Business' highest rated show, Lou Dobbs Tonight, and used the air time to promote the Hammer and Scorecard disinfo to perhaps the largest and most vulnerable audience yet to hear it. 

### Powell used the disinfo as foundation for multiple federal lawsuits challenging the election results. 

The suits would include sworn affidavits from subject matter experts testifying to the validity of the Hammer and Scorecard disinfo.  

In mid-December, General Flynn used the election hacking narrative as a basis for publicly calling for President Trump to declare Martial Law.

Flynn (along with Powell) would utilize a White House connection of discount furniture guru **Patrick Byrne** to  gain unauthorized access to the Oval Office to lobby Trump to **overturn the election by military force**. 

Less than three weeks after Trump resisted the group's efforts, the U.S. Capitol Building was stormed, with many citing election fraud and the work of Powell and Flynn as their reason for descending on the capitol.

Within 10 days of the siege, Lindell would be back at the White House using a meeting with President Trump as an opportunity to again attempt to convince him of the Hammer and Scorecard propaganda.

With Trump again resisting the gaslighting campaign, Lindell decided he would instead get the word out by producing a documentary centered around the propaganda. 

## In interviews promoting the February 5 launch of the documentary, Lindell would claim he spent over $3 million on election fraud efforts since the November 4 vote.  

He would also refer to the propaganda as a "**miracle**" and claim that "**if this doesn't work it will be the end times**".

Lindell's documentary **Absolute Proof**, was released February 5 and centered around Mary Fanning, the original author of the October 31 fake news dossier, providing a presentation of the data that is supposed to serve as evidence of the greatest crime in the history of the United States, made possible by hacking software written by her "CIA whistleblower" source, **Dennis Montgomery**.

### So who is Dennis Montgomery, the man who's word this entire operation depends upon?
